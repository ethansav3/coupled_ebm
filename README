A version of the EBM that allows you to specify atmospheric CO2.
This version includes a polynomial parameterization of outgoing
longwave radiation and planetary albedo (based on Kasting's RCE model -Jacob

>run the program by running the python script runEBM.py
>output located in model/output.dat

>added functionality which couples the energy balance model to a 
population equation (lines 766-788)
>added pCO2 adjustments, assuming constant carbon footprint (line 781)
>Added 10 Inputs to Namelist
1) N0 = initial population (millions)
2) rBirth = optimal birth rate (1/yr)
3) rDeath = optimal death rate (1/yr)
4) dTpop = exponential ramping time (civilization's fragility)
5) opT = optimum temperature (resulting in largest growth)
6) rco2 = per-capita CO2 contributions (carbon footprint)
7) En = technological capabilities of civilization
8) coupled = boolean which lets you pick if the EBM should be coupled to the population equation or not
9) lverbose = boolean which controls terminal output
10) runTime = number of years to run the program for (same as niter)
